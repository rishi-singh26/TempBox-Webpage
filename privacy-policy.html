            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p><b>Effective Date: 6th September 2024</b></p>
            <p>The following privacy policy applies to the "TempBox" or "TempBox - Anonymous Emails" (hereafter referred
                to as TempBox) application programmed by Rishi Singh, published under the name Rishi Singh and the
                website tempbox.rishisingh.in and is available under <a
                    href="https://tempbox.rishisingh.in/privacy-policy.html">tempbox.rishisingh.in/privacy-policy.html</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Tempbox does not collect any user data, so there is little to address in that regard. However, there are
                still a few points that should be clarified.</p>
            <p>By using the TempBox application, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

            <h2>Data collected by the app</h2>
            <p>The TempBox application does not collect any user data. TempBox relies on the <a
                    href="https://mail.tm/">mail.tm</a> API to deliver its functionality. While this API maintains
                server logs, these logs are not classified as Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Users are
                encouraged to review the mail.tm privacy policy, available at <a
                    href="https://mail.tm/en/privacy/">https://mail.tm/en/privacy</a>, for further details.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The TempBox application utilizes the <a href="https://mail.tm/">mail.tm</a> service to provide email
                functionality. It is recommended that you review the mail.tm privacy policy at <a
                    href="https://mail.tm/en/privacy/">https://mail.tm/en/privacy</a> to gain a better understanding of
                their data handling practices.</p>

            <h2>Data Usage</h2>
            <p>As TempBox does not collect or store any personal data, no user information is utilized for analytics,
                marketing, or any other purposes.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>TempBox does not collect or process any user information. The email addresses and messages received by
                users are stored on servers managed by <a href="https://mail.tm/">mail.tm</a>. It is recommended to
                review their privacy policy, available at <a
                    href="https://mail.tm/en/privacy/">https://mail.tm/en/privacy</a>, for further details.</p>

            <h2>Deletion of your data in the app</h2>
            <p>To delete your data, individual messages and email addresses must be manually removed. If you uninstall
                or delete the application without first deleting these messages and email addresses, they will remain
                stored on <a href="https://mail.tm/">mail.tm</a> servers.</p>

            <h2>Handling of your data on the website</h2>
            <p>This website (tempbox.rishisingh.in) does not collect any data from its visitors. It is hosted on GitHub
                Pages, and their policies apply. For more information, please review GitHub Inc.'s privacy policy
                available at <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time without prior notice. Any revisions will be posted with an
                updated effective date. Continued use of the application signifies your acceptance of any changes.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India. Any disputes arising from this policy will be
                resolved in accordance with these laws.
                <br>
                By using TempBox, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
